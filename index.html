            <p>I'm Oaklee. I'm 20 years old. I work as a region coordinator at a property preservation company.
                My hobbies include shopping, listening to music and painting. I also enjoy reading and drinking coffee.
                I have an addiction to candles - I seriously own 32 from Bath and Body works. I have two dogs, the first
                is almost 5 years old and the second one is just a little under two years old. My favorite color is
                pink.</p>
